  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
  <p>Identity and relationships under the critical magnifying glass of societal expectations and the modern age of technology
    are two monumental subjects that are intimately familiar to me. I'm nonbinary, I'm a lesbian, 
    I'm a mixed race Chinese American. No matter how much I may want to be seen simply as myself, these aspects are glowing
    neon labels dictating the path of my life.
  </p>
  <p>I also just wanna be able to give other people like myself a respite from society. Come look at this self-indulgent,
    unabashedly trashy art. Video art, digital art, games, visual novelsâ€” I just want to play around and put
    joy into the world, specifically for those like myself who often have it ripped away from us.
    *Let's get sillay.*
