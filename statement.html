  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
  <p>Identity and relationships under the critical magnifying glass of societal expectations and the modern age of technology
    are two very important subjects that are intimately familiar to me. I'm nonbinary, I'm a lesbian, 
    I'm a mixed race Chinese American. No matter how much I may want to be seen simply as myself, these aspects are glowing
    neon labels dictating the path of my life.
